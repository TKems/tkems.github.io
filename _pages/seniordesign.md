## Overview
For my Senior Design project, our team was assigned to create a device related to IoT for the Cyber Defense Competition (CDC) at ISU. The main goal is to have one device completed by the 2021 Spring CDC. The device must have vulnerabilities commonly found in IoT devices such as cameras, locks, or smart plugs. The overall goal is to have a robust device that can be changed in future CDCs and be able to be just 'dropped in'.

### My Role
My role in the senior design process is sub-team 1 Lead IoT Engineer that is focused on finding vulnerabilities and creating a VM image to be deployed on the ESXi server for each Blue team.

### Skills Gained
Currently we are working with buildroot to create a VM image and also reverse engineering the firmware of a few cameras and smart plugs in order to find common vulnerabilities.
