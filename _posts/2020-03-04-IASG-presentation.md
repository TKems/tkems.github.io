I was given the privilege to give a talk at the Information Student Assurance Student Group meeting on March 3rd, 2020. I enjoyed talking about some of my current and past projects and below you will find a link to the Google Slides and a video of the presentation on YouTube.

Some of the projects listed in the presentation are not currently on my website for one or many reasons. I hope to go into more detail as soon as possible, so stay tuned!
