---

###Overview:
Our focus during this project was to create a system where multiple users could create a party and play a game together using the player's phones and one computer as the host.

###My role:
My main focus during the project was to create the backend with my other teammate Eva. We worked together to create the MVC framework that responded to the Android web socket requests, controlled the game logic, and game save data in a backend MySQL database.

###Skills gained:
During the project I was able to get a better understanding of software development and how to work with a team to complete a medium sized software project. I also learned how to work remotely with a team as half of the semester was remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also learned the MVC framework and how to use it to implement an application that also had a strong database section.

###Resources used:
Our team used Android Studio, MVC, Eclipse, MySQL/SQL, and Linux.
